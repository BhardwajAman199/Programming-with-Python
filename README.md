## Why python?

* Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries.
* Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well.
* Python is an easy programming language for beginners to start out with

### 1. Data Science

* Python is the leading language of many data scientist. For years, academic scholars and private researchers were using the MATLAB language for scientific research but it all started to change with the release of Python numerical engines such as ‘Numpy’ and ‘Pandas’.
* python also deals with the tabular, matrix as well as statistical data and it even visualizes it with popular libraries such as ‘Matplotlib’ and ‘Seaborn

### 2. Scripting & Automation.

* This is a very useful capability that allows you to type in a program and to have it executed immediately in an interactive mode.
* The code is written in the form of scripts and get executed
* Machine reads and interprets the code
* Error checking is done during Runtime
* Once the code is checked, it can be used several times. So by automation, you can automate certain tasks in a program. 

### 3. Big Data

Python handles a lot of hassles of data. It supports parallel computing where you can use Python for Hadoop as well. In Python, you have a library called “Pydoop” and you can write a MapReduce program in Python and process data present in the HDFS cluster.

### 4. Computer Graphics

Python is largely used in small, large, online or offline projects. It is used to build GUI and desktop applications. It uses ‘Tkinter‘ library to provide fast & easy way to create applications.

### 5. Artificial Intelligence

 You can actually make a machine mimic the human brain which has the power to think, analyze and make decisions.
 Furthermore, libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow bring machine learning functionality into the mix. It gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Also, we have libraries such as openCvthat helps computer vision or image recognition.
 
### 6. Web Development

Python has an array of frameworks for developing websites. The popular frameworks are Django, Flask, Pylons etc. Since these frameworks are written in Python, its the core reason which makes the code a lot faster and stable. We can also perform web scraping where you can fetch details from any other websites. You will also be impressed as many websites such as Instagram, bit bucket, Pinterest are build on these frameworks only.

### 7. Portable & Extensible

* The portable and extensible properties of Python allow you to perform cross-language operations seamlessly. Python is supported by most platforms present in the industry today ranging from Windows to Linux to Macintosh, Solaris, Play station, among others.
* Python’s extensibility features allow you to integrate Java as well as .NET components. You can also invoke C and C++ libraries.

#### 8. Simple & Easy To Learn

* Python is Free & open source
* High-level
* Interpreted
* Blessed with large community


## Install python

* https://www.python.org/downloads/
* path? 
* In order to execute these files( javac java python (command names)), it must locate these files in path environment variables
